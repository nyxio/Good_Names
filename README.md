PUBG is a stupid acronym. PLUNKBAT is even more stupid.

To combat this, I've compiled a list of all possible contiguous deletions from the middle of the 4 core words within "PLAYERUNKNOWNSBATTLEGROUNDS"

Some of my favorites:

PLAYBAE\n
PUBAG (Pronounced Poo-Bag)\n
PLAYUNBATTLE
PLAYNSBADS
RUNSBADS
PLAYGROUND
