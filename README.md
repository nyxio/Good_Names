PUBG is a stupid acronym. PLUNKBAT is even more stupid.

To combat this, I've compiled a list of all possible contiguous deletions from the middle of the 4 core words within "PLAYERUNKNOWNSBATTLEGROUNDS"

Please pick your favorites and share them.

Some of my favorites:

PLAYBAE</br>
PUBAG (Pronounced Poo-Bag)</br>
PLAYUNBATTLE</br>
PLAYNSBADS</br>
RUNSBADS</br>
PLAYGROUND</br>
